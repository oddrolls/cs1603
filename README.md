Time Complexity of MiniMax - 
Since there is just one for-loop in action, AND since we have to sort the list, it would be O(nlogn). The sorting is the logn, and the for loop is n.


Space Complexity of MiniMax - 
I DON'T HAVE TIME
Time Complexity of Hackerrank In A String (w/ Recursion) - 
O(n-1)=O(n)

When we run our recursive HIAS, all we do is reduce the input size by 1, still resulting in n operations before we reach our base case. 

Space Complexity of MiniMax - 
Even though it lied to me and said that the output would be a string and then it demands an array, we have to consider the size of the input. The space complexity would be the amount of queries or the first integer in the input. The computer would need to store a Y/N for each query.
